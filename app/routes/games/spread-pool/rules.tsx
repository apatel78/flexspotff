      <h2>Spread Pool Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Start the season with 1000 points. Each week, you must make at least one
        bet, but may make as many as you want that fit within your budget. Max
        bet on any one game is 50 points. Payouts are paid out at even points
        for being correct. Bets lock as games start. You can't use winnings from
        the current week to bet on teams in the same week. Missing a week will
        result in forfeiting 20 points. Highest total at the end of NFL regular
        season wins.
