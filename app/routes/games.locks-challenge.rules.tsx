          Start the season with 0 points. Each week, you can select as many teams to win
          as you want to. Each correct pick will count as one point. If any of your selected
          teams does not win that week, you will be awarded 0 points for the entire week. Tie games
          will not count as a point, but will also not result in 0 points for the week. Missing a 
          week will not result in any penalty. Highest total at the end of NFL regular season wins.
